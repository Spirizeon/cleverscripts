# Switching from Vim to Emacs
> An article on how to switch from vim to emacs

Both Vim and Emacs are legendary code-editors that are known to provide infinite extensibility and blazing-fast workflow speeds. 

## Why Vim? 
Vim is a terminal-based text editor that is found in almost all modern-day unix distributions. It uses keybinds (just like emacs) and restricts the use of a mouse to maximise workflow speed so that our hands always stay on the middle row of the keyboard. However, at the end of the day, it's just a text-editor. Even though its fork, Neovim, supports a larger variety of plugins through its lua support, the configuration time is excessively high.

## Why Emacs? 
Emacs, originally a terminal-based, but now a GUI application, is renowned for its great support for plugins and massive amounts of inbuilt applications it comes with.
Just like Vim, Emacs is used mostly through the keyboard. However, the keybinds in Emacs are long and complicated, mostly using the meta(alt) key, which can cause strain injuries on the fingers due to being less ergonomic. Also, Vanilla Emacs also usually needs the user to do some confiuration so that they feel comfortable using it. But not as much as Vim.

## Which choice to make? 
Both have their respective steep learning curves, distinct from each other. You can us whatever editor you prefer or feel comfortable with, be it Vim or Emacs or even Nano! But, how about we combine both of their benefits for the ultimate developer workflow? It's possible!

## Enter: DOOM-EMACS
Doom-Emacs is a framework that is to be applied on top of the existing GNU Emacs installation to give it the ultimate makeover. With fantastic features ranging from an interactive dashboard, onedark colorscheme and even support for vim-keybinds, it reigns over the two editors in almost everything. Even configuring it is very easy and quick.
