A small article on how to carry linux on your phone everywhere you go. 

## Why carry linux? 
Here are some reasons you'd like to read:
- Allows you to SSH into your servers for any work/editing
- Gives you an instant environment for coding
- You can self-host your code on your phone and carry it (the server) everywhere!
### 1. Install Termux from [Fdroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or  [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_US&gl=US)
Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required.

### 2. Install Linux! 
You can either work your own way around it through termux or simply copy paste the script below into your termux app 
```bash
pkg install proot-distro
proot-distro install debian 
proot-distro login debian 
```
This will install the proot-distro utility that manages installations of the Linux distributions in Termux. Lastly, we're choosing debian here (any other available distro works too).
