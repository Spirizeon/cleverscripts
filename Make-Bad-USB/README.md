A small guide on how to get started with creating a bad USB (which is a corrupted USB in layman's terms)

## Components
- USB stick
- Generic script (that does anything)
- [Autorun](https://usb-autorun-creator.en.softonic.com/)

## Script 
- can be written in any language 
- must manipulate the file system
- functionality depends on extension and operating system

## Autorun
do note that the Autorun software must
- direct to the path of the USB folder
- direct to the script that is to be executed
Also, the script needs to be saved inside the autorun folder before hand.

## Warning
Only make one for joke purposes, or in mild pranks.
